Specify a list of folders to generate an excel file for.
Can only set block settings; i.e., replicate the same static settings for all files.
Good for filling out filenames and directory information so that it does not have to be done manually.

Steps:
	1. Right-click on make_excel.py -> Edit with IDLE
	2. Set the data directory "data_dir" - make sure to use two backslashes instead of one
	3. Specify the list of folders "folder_list" to generate the excel file for. This is CAsE sEnSITivE!!
		Make sure that the folders directly contain data, not nested subfolders
	4. Specify heading settings: ExportDir, Offset, AnChan, Tags, GroupInc, Comments...
	5. Specify "excel_name" for the name of the excel file, with extension type .csv (comma separated format)
		Use a datestamp to keep track, and use clear file names!!
	6. Open the generated file in Excel. You should find it in the same place as the python script.
